# StartingAnimations
Issue with animation done in SwiftUI

This project shows an issue where the animation of the "Hello world" Text from the center to the top looks very sluggish on the simulator, but looks fine on a device. It seems as it's connected to the `delay` - as removing it helps to look smooth on the simulator as well.
